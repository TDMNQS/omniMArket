# OmniMarketX Next

A production-minded frontend redesign created by **Numan Qureshi** for the OmniMarketX Future Foundry evaluatio

This is not a visual clone. It is a focused product-improvement prototype built from first-hand product testing. The work preserves OmniMarketX’s strongest idea—safe practice prediction trading—while making discovery, order review, position management, and transaction verification easier to understand.

> **Evaluation prototype:** all markets, balances, orders, people, and activity are simulated. No real funds are used. This repository is not an official OmniMarketX product or financial advice.

## Product thesis

Prediction markets ask users to make decisions under uncertainty. The interface should therefore optimize for **clarity, context, and reversible exploration**, not visual noise.

The redesign uses a compact “market intelligence workspace” model:

- the first screen is a working discovery surface, not a marketing hero;
- Demo mode and virtual buying power remain continuously visible;
- probability, movement, volume, and market rules are readable before a trade;
- the order ticket explains fees and totals before confirmation;
- Portfolio turns holdings into actions with a direct, prefilled Sell flow;
- Activity preserves the market, outcome, fee, precision, and full receipt;
- Social posts stay linked to the market being discussed.

## The problems I chose to solve

| Product observation | Why it matters | Implemented response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A purchased position was visible in Portfolio, but selling required manually finding the market again. | Extra navigation creates uncertainty and increases the chance of choosing the wrong market or outcome. | Every eligible position has a **Sell position** action. It opens the correct market in Sell mode with the owned outcome and available shares preselected. |
| The completion receipt was informative, while the visible history table omitted the market name, outcome, and fee. | Returning users could not identify similar transactions from history alone. | Contextual history rows plus a **View receipt** action that retains execution price, exact shares, fee, total, date, and transaction ID. |
| Raw precision and labels such as “Bought BUY” reduce comprehension. | Financial interfaces need intentional precision and unambiguous language. | Human-readable labels such as **BUY YES**, consistent money formatting, and four-decimal share precision only where useful. |
| Demo safety framing was strong but fragmented across screens. | First-time users should never wonder whether a real-money action occurred. | Persistent Demo badge, virtual buying power, trade disclaimer, explicit review step, and confirmation receipt. |
| Market rules were valuable but competed with the trading controls. | Users need the rules without losing the action context. | Structured resolution card with the threshold, exclusions, source, and verified-rules treatment. |

## Working features

- Responsive market discovery with category filters and three sorting modes
- Market watchlist and contextual signal rail
- Keyboard-accessible search (`Ctrl/Cmd + K`)
- Detailed probability chart, market metadata, and resolution criteria
- YES/NO demo order ticket with live fee and share calculation
- Minimum/maximum order validation and insufficient-balance protection
- Order review dialog and complete transaction receipt
- Direct Portfolio → Sell workflow with oversell protection and max-share action
- Context-rich transaction history with reopenable receipts
- Social feed with market-linked analysis and working post composer
- Dark and light themes
- Desktop, tablet, and mobile navigation patterns
- Reduced-motion support, semantic labels, focus states, and keyboard interaction

## Technical approach

- **React 19 + TypeScript** for typed, stateful UI
- **Vinext / Vite** for a Cloudflare Workers-compatible production build
- **Shadcn primitives** for accessible dialogs and buttons
- **Pure SVG charts** and CSS-native visuals to avoid unnecessary image weight
- A framework-independent market engine for quotes, fees, weighted positions, and sell validation
- Intentional component boundaries around discovery, market detail, trade ticket, Portfolio, Activity, and Social
- No external API keys, trackers, or third-party data dependencies

## Quality checks

```bash
npm ci
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build
```

The test suite covers quote precision, fee calculations, trade limits, weighted-average positions, overselling, rendered production HTML, component semantics, and the final build contract. See [docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md) for the full matrix.

## Review path

For the fastest product review:

1. Open **Portfolio** and click **Sell position** on the Ramayana holding.
2. Review the preselected market, YES outcome, owned shares, estimated proceeds, and fee.
3. Place the demo order and inspect the complete receipt.
4. Open **Activity** to see the new transaction with its market context.
5. Use **View receipt** to verify the full record.
6. Resize to a phone width to review the reordered trade-first mobile experience.
